<h2> Abstract </h2>
In cloud computing, service level agreements (SLAs) are legal agreements between a
service provider and consumer that contain a list of obligations and commitments
which need to be satisfied by both parties during the transaction. From a service
provider's perspective, a violation of such a commitment leads to penalties in terms of
money and reputation and thus has to be effectively managed. In the literature, this
problem has been studied under the domain of cloud service management. One aspect
required to manage cloud services after the formation of SLAs is to predict the future
Quality of Service (QoS) of cloud parameters to ascertain if they lead to violations.
Various approaches in the literature perform this task using different prediction
approaches however none of them study the accuracy of each. However, it is
important to do this as the results of each prediction approach vary according to the
pattern of the input data and selecting an incorrect choice of a prediction algorithm
could lead to service violation and penalties. In this, we test and report the accuracy
of time series and machine learning-based prediction approaches. Our analysis helps
the cloud service provider to choose an appropriate prediction approach (whether
time series or machine learning based) and further to utilize the best method
depending on input data patterns to obtain an accurate prediction result and better
manage their SLAs to avoid violation penalties.
